# KanbanFlow-Clone

KanbanFlow Clone is a simplified, web-based project management application inspired
by Trello. It aims to implement the core functionalities of a Kanban board to allow users to manage
their tasks and projects efficiently. The application will provide an intuitive interface for users to
create boards, lists, and cards that represent different stages of a project workflow. With a focus
on simplicity and usability, KanbanFlow Clone will be developed using basic HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for the frontend, with a Node.js backend to handle data persistence and application
logic.
