KanbanFlow Clone is a simplified, web-based project management application inspired by Trello.

It implements the core functionalities of a Kanban board to allow users to manage their tasks and projects efficiently.

The application provides an intuitive interface for users to create boards, lists, and cards that represent different stages of a project workflow.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to manage user accounts using Auth0.
- Board: A homepage to view and access all the user's workspaces and boards.
- Board/Workspace Management: Ability to create and view boards.
- Dashboard: A page to view and access all the user's tasks.
- Drag and Drop: Users can drag and drop cards between lists to update their status.
- Data Persistence: All data (users, workspaces, boards, cards) will be stored and managed in an Express.js backend with a Firebase database.
